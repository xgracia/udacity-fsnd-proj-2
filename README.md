# Project 2 for Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree

### Project Overview
You will be provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file and must replicate that design in HTML and CSS. You will develop a responsive website that will display images, descriptions and links to each of the portfolio projects you will complete throughout the course of your Nanodegree program.

The design mockup is located [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/supplemental_media/udacityu/2655898586/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf).
